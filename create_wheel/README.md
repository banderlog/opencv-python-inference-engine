# README

This is a pre-built [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) with [dldt](https://github.com/opencv/dldt) module package for Python3.
You need that module if you want to run models from [Intel's model zoo](https://github.com/opencv/open_model_zoo/).

It built with `ffmpeg` and `v4l` but without GTK/QT (use matplotlib for plotting your results).
Contrib modules and haarcascades are not included.

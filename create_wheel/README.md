# README

This is a pre-built OpenCV 4.1.0 with [dldt](https://github.com/opencv/dldt) 2019_R1 module package for Python3.

Contrib modules and haarcascades are not included.

**Why:**
There is a [guy with an exellent pre-built set of OpenCV packages](https://github.com/skvark/opencv-python), but they are all came without [dldt module](https://github.com/opencv/dldt).

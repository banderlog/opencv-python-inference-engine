# TODO list

+ get rid of tensorflow-cpu in tests
+ Auto value for `-D INF_ENGINE_RELEASE`: https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues/1435
+ <https://answers.opencv.org/question/236271/what-the-difference-between-cv_version_status-values/>
+ `ENABLE_AVX512F`, how often you see such CPUs in clouds?
+ `avresample` from ffmpeg to the opencv, do we need it?
+ `se_net.xml` downloads badly
+ results of `test_inference_engine()[::-1]`
